GWSThreadNetKit
===============



# Usage

if library, describe how to download library using jitpack than describe how to use the library.

I use jitpack to upload my libraries so you put this in your root buildscript:

```groovy
allprojects {
        repositories {
            jcenter()
            maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
        }
   }
```
Than in the module buildscript:


```groovy
compile 'com.github.shareme:GWSThreadNetKit:{latest-release-number}@aar'
```
